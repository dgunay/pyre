# Pyre

A simple console Reddit browser in Python using the Urwid library. WIP.

## Goals

Make a pretty console app that lets you browse Reddit comments on the console.

## Stretch Goals

Compatibility across Linux and Windows (currently only works on Linux because
Urwid has a Linux-only dependency). I'm not totally married to Python and am
willing to ditch it if I go this far.
